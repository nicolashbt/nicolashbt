Welcome to my website, I started this project for a few reasons:

    I want to show my future employers what I can do
    I want to improve my skills with React and Javascript
    I want to keep coding while I'm looking for a job

On this website, you can find a few pages:

    A home page which you are on right now.
    A marketplace where you can add and consult ads for music equipement
    A contact page in case you want to get in touch
    An about page showing the code, the technologies used, etc.
    Authentication pages if you want to try all the features of the marketplace
